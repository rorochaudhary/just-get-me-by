# Just Get Me By
Youâ€™re studying hard, absorbing the material, and you are kicking butt on the assignments. However, rumors are flying that the upcoming final is known to ruin grades, and along with your other responsibilities it just may not be feasible to dedicate the effort you usually do give in order to get the grade you want.

This is where Just Get Me By comes in. This is a streamlined desktop app that gathers your coursework, assignments, scores, and grades from your Canvas class(es) and tells you the minimum target scores needed on upcoming assignments in order to get that A.
